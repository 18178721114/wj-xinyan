<p>高血压眼底病变的中重度的患者，一般都有高血压病史。临床病程呈慢性经过的高血压患者中，眼底改变与病程长短呈正比。血压增高程度越大，眼底改变越严重，舒张压增高对眼底病变的作用更为显著。</p><p>慢性高血压患者一般从眼底动脉硬化开始进展成中重度病变。急进性高血压（包括慢性肾炎、肾病综合征等）常可直接出现重度视网膜病变。</p>	______	<p>Patients with moderate to severe hypertensive fundus lesions generally have a history of hypertension. In hypertensive patients with a chronic clinical course, the fundus changes were proportional to the duration of the disease. The greater the degree of blood pressure increase, the more serious the fundus changes, and the more significant effect of increased diastolic blood pressure on fundus lesions. </p><p>Patients with chronic hypertension generally progress from fundus arteriosclerosis to moderate to severe disease. Rapidly progressive hypertension (including chronic nephritis, nephrotic syndrome, etc.) often leads to severe retinopathy directly. </p>
<p>是病理性近视引起的视网膜病变。病理性近视与高度近视和遗传关系密切，是一种视网膜变性疾病。一般表现为在青春期前视力即开始下降并持续性加深，随着近视度数加深，眼轴明显延长，视功能会明显受损。</p><p>病理性近视可并发黄斑裂孔、视网膜脱离等致盲病变，需要定期复查。</p>	______	<p>Retinopathy caused by pathological myopia. Pathological myopia is closely related to high myopia and genetics, and is a retinal degenerative disease. It is generally manifested that the visual acuity begins to decline before puberty and continues to deepen. With the deepening of myopia, the axial length of the eye is significantly prolonged, and the visual function will be significantly impaired. </p><p>Pathological myopia can be complicated by macular hole, retinal detachment and other blinding lesions, which requires regular review. </p>
<p>杯盘比偏大，提示青光眼风险。青光眼是导致人类失明的三大致盲眼病之一，早期无症状。如果有眼痛、眼胀、虹视（灯光周围出现彩色色环）等症状、青光眼家族史、高度近视，提示青光眼可能性，建议去医院进一步检查。</p><p>当然，有一少部分人的杯盘比偏大是天生的，不是疾病的症状，如果没有以上症状和高危风险因素，并且没有收到立即就医的提示，生理性杯盘比偏大的可能性较大，可以先观察，定期检查杯盘比是否有变化。</p>	______	<p>The abnormal ratio of cup/disc indicates the risk of glaucoma. Glaucoma is one of the three major blindness diseases that cause blindness in humans. If you have symptoms such as eye pain, eye swelling, rainbow vision (colored rings around lights), family history of glaucoma, and high myopia, it indicates the possibility of glaucoma, and it is recommended to go to the hospital for further examination. </p><p>Of course, a small number of people's cup-to-disk ratio is inborn, not a symptom of a disease. If you don't have the above symptoms and high-risk risk factors, and you don't receive prompt medical attention, a physiological cup-to-disk ratio is not a symptom. It is more likely that the ratio is too large. You can observe it first and regularly check whether the cup-to-plate ratio has changed. </p>
<p>视网膜的动脉是人体全身唯一可以直接观察到的血管。正常的血管为了让血液流动顺畅，所以内壁非常柔软，动脉弹性减弱是血管硬化的初期表现，血管硬化会导致血管内腔变窄，使得血液循环不顺畅，继续恶化甚至会导致血管堵塞。</p><p>血压、血脂、血糖异常，长期紧张、疲劳、内分泌、免疫调节不佳等均可导致血管硬化。</p><p>目前不需要做针对性治疗，但是需要注意戒烟限酒，动静平衡、合理饮食，保持全身血管的健康度。</p>	______	<p>The arteries of the retina are the only blood vessels in the body that can be directly observed. In order to make the blood flow smoothly, the inner wall of normal blood vessels is very soft. The weakening of arterial elasticity is the initial manifestation of arteriosclerosis. Arteriosclerosis will lead to narrowing of the lumen of the blood vessels, making the blood circulation unsmooth, and further deterioration may even lead to blood vessel blockage. </p><p>Blood pressure, blood lipids, abnormal blood sugar, long-term stress, fatigue, poor endocrine and immune regulation can all lead to vascular sclerosis. </p><p>Currently, there is no need for targeted treatment, but attention should be paid to quitting smoking and limiting alcohol, living an active lifestyle, eating a reasonable diet, and maintaining the health of blood vessels throughout the body. </p>
<p>玻璃膜疣是视网膜上色素代谢异常病变，是一种年龄性改变，就像皮肤一样随着年龄的增长而衰老会长色斑一样，受光照强度越高，损伤越明显。该病变如果不明显影响视力，一般不需要专科治疗，请控制用眼强度，适当补充富含叶黄素的食品，延缓老化。</p><p>根据大数据分析，近年由于电子屏幕的普及和大量使用，导致此病变发生的概率增大，并且呈现低龄化的趋势。</p>	______	<p>Drusen is an abnormal pigment metabolism lesion on the retina. It is an age-related change. Just like the skin, aging will lead to pigment spots with age. The higher the light intensity, the more obvious the damage. If the lesion does not significantly affect vision, it generally does not require specialist treatment. Please control the intensity of eye use and appropriately supplement foods rich in lutein to delay aging. </p><p>According to the analysis of big data, due to the popularization and extensive use of electronic screens in recent years, the probability of occurrence of this lesion has increased, and it has shown a trend of younger age. </p>
<p>视网膜出现少量出血，有可能是疲劳、用眼过度、饮酒等引起的暂时性情况，休息后可吸收恢复，也可能是全身性血管病和血液病如高血压，糖尿病等视网膜病变反应，或者是炎症性疾患或免疫复合物侵犯血管壁等各种原因。请结合实际情况，定期观察或者进一步检查。</p>	______	<p>A small amount of retinal hemorrhage may be a temporary condition caused by fatigue, overuse, drinking, etc., which can be absorbed and recovered after rest, or a systemic vascular disease and blood disease such as hypertension, diabetes and other retinopathy reactions, or various reasons such as inflammatory diseases or immune complexes invading the vessel wall. Please make regular observations or further inspections based on the actual situation. </p>
<p>杯盘比偏大是指视杯和视盘的比值大于绝大多数人群的平均范围，与青光眼风险相关，青光眼是导致人类失明的三大致盲风险之一，早期无明显表现，如果出现眼痛、眼胀、虹视、（灯光周围彩色环）等表现，或者存在青光眼家族史、高度近视等情况，建议在专业机构进一步检查。</p><p>少部分人的杯盘比偏大是天生的，并非与青光眼风险相关的改变，如果没有以上表现，且未收到工作人员的通知，那么出现生理性杯盘比偏大的可能性较大，应该定期检查。</p>	______	<p>The abnormal ratio of cup/discmeans that the ratio of the optic cup to the optic disc is greater than the average range of the vast majority of the population, and is related to the risk of glaucoma. Glaucoma is one of the three major blindness risks that cause blindness in humans. There is no obvious early manifestation. Eye pain, eye swelling, rainbow vision, (colored ring around the light) and other manifestations, or there is a family history of glaucoma, high myopia, etc., it is recommended to further check in a professional institution. </p><p>The large cup-to-disk ratio of a small number of people is innate, not a change related to the risk of glaucoma. It is more likely to be large and should be checked regularly. </p>
<p>视网膜出现少量的红色斑点，属于视网膜零星出血的类似改变，可能是疲劳、用眼过度、饮酒等引起的暂时性改变，休息后可吸收恢复，也可能是全身血管损伤的眼部类似表现，如本身已有血液功能异常、糖代谢和血压调节功能失衡等改变，建议结合实际情况，定期观察或在专业机构进一步检查。</p>	______	<p>A small amount of red spots appear on the retina, which are similar to sporadic retinal hemorrhages. They may be temporary changes caused by fatigue, overuse, drinking, etc., which can be absorbed and recovered after rest. It may also be similar to the eyes with systemic blood vessel damage. For symptoms such as abnormal blood function, imbalance of glucose metabolism and blood pressure regulation, etc., it is recommended to observe the actual situation regularly or conduct further examination in professional institutions. </p>

视网膜疾病<br/>视网膜居于眼球壁的内层，是一层透明的薄膜。视信息在视网膜上形成视觉神经冲动，沿视路将视信息传递到视中枢形成视觉，这样在我们的头脑中建立起图像。<br/>视网膜疾病的症状表现为中心视力减退，大部分视网膜疾病可引发视网膜脱离，造成视力急剧下降。部分视网膜疾病可并发白内障、青光眼等。<br/>脉络膜疾病<br/>脉络膜的主要功能是营养视网膜外层及玻璃体，并有遮光作用，使反射的物象清楚。 同时对人的视觉系统起保护作用，对整个视觉神经有调节作用。<br/>脉络膜疾病严重时可引起视力下降和视物变形，并可能并发视网膜脱离。	______	Retinal Diseases The retina resides in the inner layer of the eyeball wall and is a transparent membrane. The visual information forms visual nerve impulses on the retina, and the visual information is transmitted to the visual center along the visual pathway to form vision, thus establishing images in our minds. <br/>The symptoms of retinal diseases are loss of central vision, and most retinal diseases can cause retinal detachment, resulting in a sharp decline in vision. Some retinal diseases can be complicated by cataracts, glaucoma, etc. <br/>Coroidal disease<br>The main function of the choroid is to nourish the outer layer of the retina and the vitreous body, and it also has the function of shading light to make the reflected image clear. At the same time, it has a protective effect on the human visual system and has a regulating effect on the entire optic nerve.
